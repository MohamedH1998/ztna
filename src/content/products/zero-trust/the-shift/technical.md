  description: The perimeter collapsed. Network-level trust became the liability.

The old security model assumed a clear perimeter. Remote work + cloud erased it. VPNs grant network-level access after a single login, increasing lateral movement risk and expanding attack surface.

Zero Trust makes access app-scoped and decisioned per request using explicit context + policy. This reduces blast radius while improving control and user experience.
