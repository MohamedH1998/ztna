The old model: 'Connect to the network, get the keys to the castle.' If an attacker gets in, they get everything. This is why ransomware spreads.

The new model (Zero Trust): 'Earn access to one door at a time.' You don't connect to a network. You just access an app. It's safer because a compromised device can't attack other systems. It's faster because you don't backhaul traffic through a slow VPN.
