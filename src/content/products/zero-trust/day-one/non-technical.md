You don't have to replace everything at once. Start with one internal tool (like a wiki or admin panel). Put it behind Cloudflare Zero Trust. It takes 15 minutes. Then add one team. Then another. It's a gradual upgrade, not a scary switch.

This is a 'parallel adoption'. Your old VPN stays running while you move apps over one by one. Users won't even notice the difference, except that things get faster.
