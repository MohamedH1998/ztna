Cloudflare Zero Trust doesn't just control access to private applications. The same policy engine governs SaaS apps and public web destinations. You can enforce the same identity and device requirements whether users access your internal CRM, Salesforce, or any public website.

This eliminates the fragmentation of separate tools: no more VPN for private apps, SSO for SaaS, and a different proxy for web filtering. One policy framework, one set of logs, one place to manage access controls across all destinations.
