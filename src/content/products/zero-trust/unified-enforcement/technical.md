Cloudflare applies a unified policy model across private apps, SaaS, and web destinations. This replaces fragmented controls (VPN for private, SSO for SaaS, inconsistent web controls) with consistent enforcement.

Same decision inputs (identity + device posture + context) inform policy regardless of destination type. The win is consistency, simpler operations, and fewer gaps.
