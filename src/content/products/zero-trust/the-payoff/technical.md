The Cloudflare team measured 95th percentile Response Time and Time to First Byte (TTFB) to capture the real end-user experience. For Secure Web Gateway, Cloudflare (164ms) was comparable to direct internet access, while Zscaler (366ms) added significant latency.

The key differentiator is 'Proxy Latency'—the time spent processing on the edge. Zscaler's proxy latency often exceeds 100ms (missing their own SLA), whereas Cloudflare's is consistently around 7ms.
