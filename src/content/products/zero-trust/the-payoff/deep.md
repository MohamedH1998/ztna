Methodology: We compared Cloudflare against Zscaler using identical VMs in the same locations (Miercom validated). The performance gap stems from architecture. Zscaler's 'service chaining' adds latency as traffic hops between services.

Cloudflare's 'single pass' architecture processes identity, device posture, and policy in one go. Additionally, Cloudflare's highly peered network (connected to >12,000 networks) reduces the number of hops to the destination, ensuring the proxy is not a bottleneck.
