Performance matters because it impacts your employees' experience. If security tools are slow, users bypass them, putting the organization at risk. The Cloudflare team tested Zero Trust platform against Zscaler and found significant advantages.

Cloudflare Gateway is 58% faster than Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA). Cloudflare Access is 38% faster than Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). Cloudflare Browser Isolation is 45% faster than Zscaler. Fast security means your team stays safe without slowing down.
